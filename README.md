# The Laughing Man

"I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes"

After seeing ARKit demos where people were creating masks and filters with the iphone X front camera I wondered if 
something was possible. One of my favorite shows is Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex. 
The Laughing Man is a huge character in the show and has a logo covering his face to hide his identity. 
I thought it would be awesome to create this with ARKit. After some trial and error I made a version of the logo in SceneKit.
You can record youself with a video and edit it as well to share it with others. You can also use the rear camera to track a users face in real time and display the logo. Just wanted to share this fun project hope you like it :)
